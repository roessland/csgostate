<h2>What is CS:GO's gamestate integration?</h2>
<p>CS:GO has builtin support for sharing some in-game information with external services. Some examples of shared
    information:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your own HP, ammo, weapon</li>
    <li>The map you are playing on</li>
    <li>The current score</li>
    <li>If you are T side: Whether the bomb is planted or not</li>
</ul>

<p>Some examples of information that is NOT present in gamestate updates:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Any player location.</li>
    <li>Any match, game, server or IP address information.</li>
    <li>Exact bomb plant timing. This is intentionally fudged by the game to prevent using gamestate integration to
        create bomb timers.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>This is typically used for peripheral integrations such as lighting up your RGB keyboard when your health is low.</p>
<p>More data is available if you are hosting or spectating a match, but if you are playing in the match
    yourself the amount of data is very limited, so there is no cheating potential here, and no ban risk either.</p>
<p>Enabling gamestate integration requires dropping a small config file in your CS:GO directory</p>

<h2>How to use CS:GO State</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        First, sign in with Steam to register an account.
    </li>
    <li>Download your gamestate config file and move it to this directory:
        <ul>
            <li>Windows: <b>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg</b>
            </li>
            <li>MacOS: <b>/Users/{USER}/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global
                Offensive/csgo/cfg</b></li>
        </ul>
        You must restart CS:GO for changes in this directory to be detected by the game.
        Make sure the filename is <b>gamestate_integration_csgostate.cfg</b> and not <b>gamestate_integration_csgostate.cfg.txt</b>
        or similar.
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>That's it! Your gamestate changes will now be pushed to our API.</li>
</ol>
